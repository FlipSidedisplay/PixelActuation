# PixelActuation
This is a repository for all the relevant code for the FlipSide display board 

This script will be executed on the Arduino Uno for the purpose of integrating 
the stepper motor and solenoids to actuate the pixels in order to reach a 
desired display 

The Fall prototype currently has the following characteristics:
-Pixel shape as a triangular prism
-Height of 0.5" with a face width of ~0.4"
-A display of 5 x 20 pixels
-Moving carriage of 5 solenoids positioned vertically
-Stepper motor/lead screw linear actuator
-Horizontal movement
